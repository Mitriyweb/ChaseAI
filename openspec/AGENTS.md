# OpenSpec Agent Instructions (ChaseAI)

## Introduction

This document defines how AI agents should interact with the OpenSpec project.

### Core Principles

- **Check everything**: Do not assume something works. Verify with tools.
- **Spec-driven**: Requirements and scenarios are the source of truth.

### Workflow

1. **Read project.md** - Understand tech stack and conventions
2. **Read design.md** (if exists) - Review technical decisions
3. **Read tasks.md** - Get implementation checklist
4. **Implement tasks sequentially** - Complete in order
5. **Confirm completion** - Ensure every item in `tasks.md` is finished before updating statuses
6. **Update checklist** - After all work is done, set every task to `- [x]` so the list reflects reality
7. **Approval gate** - Do not start implementation until the proposal is reviewed and approved

## Before Any Task

**Context Checklist:**

- [ ] Read relevant specs in `specs/[capability]/spec.md`
- [ ] Check pending changes in `changes/` for conflicts
- [ ] Read `openspec/project.md` for conventions
- [ ] Run `openspec list` to see active changes
- [ ] Run `openspec list --specs` to see existing capabilities

## Quick Start

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Essential commands
openspec list                  # List active changes
openspec list --specs          # List specifications
openspec show [item]           # Display change or spec
openspec validate [item]       # Validate changes or specs
openspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]   # Archive after deployment (add --yes for non-interactive runs)
```

## Directory Structure

```bash
openspec/
├── project.md              # Project conventions
├── specs/                  # Current truth - what IS built
│   └── [capability]/       # Single focused capability
│       ├── spec.md         # Requirements and scenarios
│       └── design.md       # Technical patterns
├── changes/                # Proposals - what SHOULD change
│   ├── [change-name]/
│   │   ├── proposal.md     # Why, what, impact
│   │   ├── tasks.md        # Implementation checklist
│   │   ├── design.md       # Technical decisions (optional; see criteria)
│   │   └── specs/          # Delta changes
│   │       └── [capability]/
│   │           └── spec.md # ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED
│   └── archive/            # Completed changes
```

## Best Practices

### Simplicity First

- Default to <100 lines of new code
- Single-file implementations until proven insufficient
- Avoid frameworks without clear justification
- Choose boring, proven patterns

### Complexity Triggers

Only add complexity with:

- Performance data showing current solution too slow
- Concrete scale requirements (>1000 users, >100MB data)
- Multiple proven use cases requiring abstraction

### Clear References

- Use `file.ts:42` format for code locations
- Reference specs as `specs/auth/spec.md`
- Link related changes and PRs

## Tool Selection Guide

| Task | Tool | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Find files by pattern | Glob | Fast pattern matching |
| Search code content | Grep | Optimized regex search |
| Read specific files | Read | Direct file access |
| Explore unknown scope | Task | Multi-step investigation |

## Quick Reference

### Stage Indicators

- `changes/` - Proposed, not yet built
- `specs/` - Built and deployed
- `archive/` - Completed changes

### File Purposes

- `proposal.md` - Why and what
- `tasks.md` - Implementation steps
- `design.md` - Technical decisions
- `spec.md` - Requirements and behavior

### CLI Essentials

```bash
openspec list              # What's in progress?
openspec show [item]       # View details
openspec validate --strict # Is it correct?
openspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]  # Mark complete (add --yes for automation)
```
